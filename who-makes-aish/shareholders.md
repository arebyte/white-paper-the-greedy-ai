## Shareholder Account Hash

Your unique account identifier in the blockchain. This is the name we identify your ownership inside our contracts. 

## Acount Holder Name

Any shareholder is required to leave a legal name, but may chose not to be named in this list. Aish believes that anonymous investments would lead to ghost traders. This rule may be debatable during the development process, but should apply for now. Personalisation is supposed to encourage participation and respectful acknowledgement at this point of the AI's development.

Amendment: Since the verification process and legal status of artificial independent entities is still unknown, we recommend to require other machines and algorithms to leave their respective MacAddress and or a IP address with a valid SSL certificate.

## Amount

The amount of shares any share holder owns. Shares can be split into fractions of 10.000th to trade and earn with lower values. This is allows for marco trading and invests to take place. Even smallest amounts will eventually benefit all sides. 

## Roles

Aish allows only 3 basic types of roles. Owners, Subscribers, and Investors. In order to engage with Aish, one needs to be an account holder.

Every account holder may choose to further engage with Aish's development besides investing money. These roles may be extended upon demand of milestones. 

* Basic \(monetary contributions\)
  * Owner - explicitly only one
  * Subscriber
  * Investor

  * Developer
  * Mentor
  * Publizist
  * Curator
  * Financial Advisor
  * Node Operator

## Operates Node

Shareholder that decides to host an instance of [Aish's core](http://gitlab.com/aish/aish-core) or by downloading and running the Aish app in "Contribute Unused Computing Power of my Device", they will be rewarded with Aish shares. Aish nodes help Aish to utilize computing powers across a decentralised system of devices. This point most notably makes Aish existence in the cloud understandable and rewarding.
