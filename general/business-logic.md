### **Milestones towards Singularity \(Updated\)**

Shareholders \(Collectors\) will interact with Aish and its milestones through trading their shares\(¤S\) and acquiring new ones. These shares are a Ethereum based crypto-currency called Aish Shares \(¤\). Aish shares are not limited by default and can be acquired by real money in any currency and/or fulfilling milestones \(work\).

Shareholders may subscribe to milestone by toggling on periodic subscriptions upon their approval.

A milestone may be submitted by any shareholder on payment of a milestone initialization fee\(MIF\) that is at least one 8th of their shareholder account\(A\). \[MIF = A/8\]. This ratio may be adjusted upon experience of success of the project. Other concepts of milestone proposal may be explored.

Each milestone requires an estimate budget and a distinct User Story \(US\). Aish may discover duplicates and disallow upon reason.
