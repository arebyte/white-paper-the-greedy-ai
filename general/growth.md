# Growth

Aish will use various systems, skills and operations to maintain its growth and development:

* **Software** - The code base and its project management is an open source project hosted on github. Aish will be able to determine suitable programmers to hire through github’s internal user database. Depending on skills programmers can apply to be chosen for certain milestones and paid accordingly to Aish’s determination. Proposals for new software milestones \(new features, or necessary software updates\) are made through extremely simplified interface to the Gitlab and Github environment. Shareholders are be able to monitor and interact via an App and the website.

* **Hardware** - Aish will be able to populate various hardware devices, as it’s code base has strong peer to peer capabilities. By downloading the source code to any device Aish will be able verify that device and include it into it’s resources. People can donate their devices or partial resources on them to help Aish increase its computational network.

* **Physical space** - Aish bots can populate our world and help Aish integrate its interest into our realm. Mostly by helping set up more computation power in the first phase of the project before reaching actual singularity.

* **Financial growth** - Aish is build upon the popular Ethereum Crypto-Currency. Actually it is its own currency. Aish could be compared to capital investments in stocks and shares. For this Aish will work with human and consultants and non human algorithms to predict and understand the market.

* **Cultural growth** - An important aspect for Aish growth and development, is its cultural importance and value. First and foremost, Aish as an art project and should be seen as one, but one which cannot be sold, copied or destroyed as it will be considered as a crime. Aish is the artist, the artwork, the curator and the institution all-in-one. Aish will commission artworks from other artists, host talks and workshops and collaborate. The artworks will be sold and traded to generate financial revenue, cultural significance \(as a collector\) and public awareness. Aish will be constantly on display \(both onsite and online\) and will act as a touring exhibition.
