# Aish Api \(aish-api\)

## Objective

Interchange communications between all [Aish Services](/technical-documentation/aish-services.md) and provide access to third-party operators and applications. 

### Requirements

API Pricing defers on the typ of application. Data Services and computing power may be more expensive than trading and user information retrieval. Free API endpoints may be made available for social media integrations and newsreaders.

> If does not supply a required endpoint for you needs, feel free to propose a milestone. Keep in mind, that milestones may also be financed by a single investor and are very likely to succeed. The higher the profit margin between a milestone goal and the amount invested is, the better the rating. Hence the milestone may move up in priority.
